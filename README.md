#### Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline:

**Advanced end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using structured telecom data:**

* Robust data preprocessing: including missing value imputation, feature engineering with polynomial interactions, and categorical encoding.  
* Automated hyperparameter tuning: via cross-validated grid search to maximize model performance.  
* Powerful Gradient Boosting Classification: for accurate, interpretable predictions.  
* Comprehensive evaluation: with classification reports, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.  
* State-of-the-art model explainability: using SHAP values to interpret feature impact on churn predictions.


#### Features:

- Numerical and categorical pipelines: Clean separation of numerical and categorical data preprocessing.  
- Polynomial features: Generation to capture non-linear relationships.  
- Hyperparameter optimization: Systematic tuning to boost model generalization.  
- Model metrics: Detailed classification reports and visualizations for actionable insights.  
- Interpretability: Transparent model interpretation building stakeholder trust and auditability.


#### Tech Stack:

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
- Scikit-learn for pipeline building and model training  
- SHAP for explainable AI  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations  


#### Usage:

1. Clone repository  
2. Place `telecom_churn.csv` dataset in the root directory  
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn shap matplotlib seaborn
